    "NAVO has started regularly querying some TAP and Cone Search services to collect data on their response times.  So far this is mostly NAVO services, but also includes a CDS 2MASS cone search for comparison.  (Some Chandra Source Catalog queries are also done, but due to sparse sky coverage these need to be adjusted.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The queries are done using the `servicemon` application (https://servicemon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and are executed from several different locations.  The AWS instrumentation is handled with the software at https://github.com/NASA-NAVO/AWS_servicemon.  The results are written to a TAP-accessible database currently running at IPAC.\n",
