    "# Overview\n",
    "The source for this notebook can be found at https://github.com/NASA-NAVO/servicemon/blob/main/servicemon/analysis/notebooks/ExplorePerformanceData.ipynb.\n",
    "\n",
    "NAVO has started regularly querying some TAP and Cone Search services to collect data on their response times.  So far this is mostly NAVO services, but also includes a CDS 2MASS cone search for comparison.  (Some Chandra Source Catalog queries are also done, but due to sparse sky coverage these need to be adjusted.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The queries are done using the `servicemon` application (https://servicemon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and are executed from several different locations.  The AWS instrumentation is handled with the software at https://github.com/NASA-NAVO/AWS_servicemon.  The results are written to a TAP-accessible database currently running at IPAC.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaborating\n",
    "Now that all can examine the monitoring data and run additional tests, all can contribute:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Analyzing response data.\n",
    "  - Explaining anomalous or poor measurements (is the issue with the service, network, servicemon, etc.?)\n",
    "  - Addressing major performance issues.\n",
    "  \n",
    " - Developing other plots, analysis or alerts.\n",
    "  - What plots (like those below?) are worth posting somewhere on web?\n",
    " \n",
    " - Maintaining the operational monitoring.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Monitoring parameters\n",
    "  - Should services be added/removed from the monitoring list?\n",
    "  - Is the current cadence OK?\n",
    "  - Do we agree that we should add in non-random queries so we have more concrete comparison data?\n",
    "  - TAP queries are currently all async.  We've found this adds significant overhead in some cases.  Should routine or one off monitoring include sync TAP queries?\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    " - Open Development participation in `servicemon` and `AWS_servicemon`.\n",
    "  - Filing, discussing and prioritizing issues.\n",
    "  - Bug fix and feature development.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Known Issues/Action Items\n",
    "Short term:\n",
    " - Probably should add some non-random queries to suite.\n",
    "\n",
    "Longer term:\n",
    " - Consider controlling inputs on a per service basis due to differences in density and coverage.\n",
    " - Support non-positional queries (TAP, DataLink, non-VO services)\n",
    " \n",
    "# What Tests Are Run\n",
    "All of the parameters of the queries are configurable, but below is what is currently running.  TAP queries now are all async.\n",

    "A set of 10 random cone queries, with radii ranging from 0 to 0.25 degrees, is run for each service every 6 hours.  The exact hours are staggered by location.\n",

    "The queries are run from the following AWS regions:\n",
